- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I felt with this assignment the idea of inheritance was more conceptual, and mostly just applied to using the "super" keyword in the constructor classes. I'm interested in using inheritance more with private variables and accessors - seeing where those new boundaries lie when using the methods of a parent class. Does that make sense?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Maybe I did something wrong, but I expected this assignment to force us to use more of the inherited methods. I think that would demonstrate the value of inheritance even more!
